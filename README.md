### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Brooklyn-born, Guatemalan-spiced data scientist (certs: Flatiron, Jovian, Google, codeAcademy, DataCamp, LinkedIn Learning) and machine learning engineer with a deep love for all things data, fitness, and guacamole! I have a long background in legal work, fitness, hospitality management, and acting!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a machine learning program that can accurately classify your BMI being only given your lifestyle habits (how much water do you drink in a day? How many veggies do you eat in a day? etc) and not your height or weight (how BMI is normally classified)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript and C++! I know I know, those languages aren't really needed for data science but I want to go for my Masters in Data Science and need to know some other languages to do so
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects (especially innovative ones), I LOVE machine learning
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data science, computer science, but also happy to answer questions about fitness, hospitality, and acting too (not legal because my experience was mainly as a paralegal, not an attorney)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: cdelacruz2013@gmail.com 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His
- âš¡ Fun fact: I LOVE to cook! I've taken many cooking classes and workshops in the city and always love cooking new and innovative dishes as often as I can!
